Building a scheduler system with the described features in Golang involves several components. Let's break down each component and discuss how you can implement them:

### 1. Task Scheduling
To implement cron-like scheduling in Golang, you can use a package like `robfig/cron` which provides a cron spec parser and job runner. This library allows you to define cron schedules and attach tasks to be executed at those scheduled times.

- **Basic Implementation**: Define cron schedules using the standard cron format (e.g., `0 30 17 * * FRI` for every Friday at 5:30 pm). For event-based triggers, you can use Go's native concurrency features like goroutines and channels to listen for specific events and trigger tasks.

### 2. Workflow Integration
Integrating with DevOps tools, especially for git operations, can be achieved by executing shell commands from your Go application. You can use the `os/exec` package to run git commands.

- **Git Operations**: To run a git push operation, you would use `exec.Command("git", "push")`. Ensure that your Go application has the necessary permissions and is configured correctly to access the git repositories.

### 3. Notifications and Reminders
Implementing a notification system requires a way to send messages or alerts to the user. This can be done through various means like emails, Slack messages, or webhooks.

- **Email Notifications**: You can use SMTP packages in Go to send emails. For Slack notifications, you can use Slack's API with a Go HTTP client.
- **Scheduling Notifications**: Set up a separate cron job or a timer in your Go application that triggers the notification a certain amount of time before the task is due to start.

### 4. Script Execution
Executing scripts at scheduled times can be handled similarly to executing git operations. You'll use the `os/exec` package to run scripts. However, ensure that you manage execution permissions and environment settings securely.

- **Security Considerations**: Avoid running untrusted scripts. Validate and sanitize any user input that might be used in the script execution context. Consider running scripts in a sandboxed environment to isolate them from the main system.

### Additional Tips:
- **Testing**: Thoroughly test each component. For cron jobs, make sure the scheduling works as expected and handles edge cases (e.g., daylight saving time changes).
- **Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging for each task execution. This is crucial for debugging and monitoring the system's health.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling, especially for the script execution and external command invocations.

### Go Modules to Consider:
- `robfig/cron` for cron scheduling.
- `os/exec` for executing external commands and scripts.
- `net/smtp` for sending emails.
- Various HTTP client libraries for interacting with APIs (e.g., Slack).

### Resources:
- Go documentation for packages like `os/exec` and `net/smtp`.
- Cron library documentation: [robfig/cron](https://github.com/robfig/cron).
- Slack API documentation for sending notifications.

Remember, security should be a top priority, especially when executing external scripts or integrating with other tools. Always validate and sanitize inputs, and consider the least privilege principle when setting up execution environments.
